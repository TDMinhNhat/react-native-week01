// Your tasks: 
// 1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called 'EV') as a child 
// "class" of 'Car'. Besides a make and current speed, the 'EV' also has the 
// current battery charge in % ('charge' property) 
// 2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument 
// 'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo' 
// 3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20, 
// and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140 
// km/h, with a charge of 22%' 
// 4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate', 
// 'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when 
// you 'accelerate'! Hint: Review the definiton of polymorphism 

class Car {
  constructor(make, speed) {
    this.make = make;
    this.speed = speed;
  }

  accelerate() {
    this.speed += 10;
    console.log(`${this.make} going at ${this.speed} km/h`);
  }

  brake() {
    this.speed -= 5;
    console.log(`${this.make} going at ${this.speed} km/h`);
  }
}

class EV extends Car {
  constructor(make, speed, charge) {
    super(make, speed);
    this.charge = charge;
  }

  chargeBattery(chargeTo) {
    this.charge = chargeTo;
  }

  accelerate() {
    this.speed += 20;
    this.charge -= 1;
    console.log(`${this.make} going at ${this.speed} km/h, with a charge of ${this.charge}%`);
  }
}

const tesla = new EV('Tesla', 120, 23);
tesla.chargeBattery(90);
tesla.accelerate();
tesla.brake();
