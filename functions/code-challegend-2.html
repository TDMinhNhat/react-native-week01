// Your tasks: 
// 1. Take the IIFE below and at the end of the function, attach an event listener that 
// changes the color of the selected h1 element ('header') to blue, each time 
// the body element is clicked. Do not select the h1 element again! 
// 2. And now explain to yourself (or someone around you) why this worked! Take all 
// the time you need. Think about when exactly the callback function is executed, 
// and what that means for the variables involved in this example. 

        (function() {
            const header = document.querySelector('h1');
            header.style.color = 'blue';
        })()
